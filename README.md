## Introduction

Car Price Prediction using TensorFlow is a comprehensive project that uses various car features such as make, model, year, and mileage to predict car prices. This project is ideal for those interested in practical applications of deep learning and TensorFlow in real-world scenarios.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: A dataset containing car features and prices.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for model training.
- **Model Building**: Creating and training a predictive model using TensorFlow.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance and accuracy.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VijayMakkad/Car-Price-Prediction.git
cd Car-Price-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the project with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation pipeline.
